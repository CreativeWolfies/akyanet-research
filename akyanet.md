## Introduction

The purpose of Akyanet is to be a better society and an accessible one.
This will never be a perfect society because it does not exist.
But we can try to go as close as possible to this utopia.

## Our world and our society

### What's wrong?

Actually, a lot.
The ubiquity of the money for example.
Money gives power.
And this power is concentrated in hands of a few people.
It creates gaps between people and makes us go straight into the wall.
Corruption exists mainly because of money.

Money is not the only problem.
There is also weapons of mass destruction, war, unfair justice, lack of equality, etc.
We live in a world where the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles to be part of the so-called "bourgeoisie" in the hope of feeling better.
There is something wrong about this system.
We dream of becoming rich to get the things we like.
And to do this, our current society suggests that we must compete against others and forget the ones at the bottom because they "deserved it".

### I'm fine with this system, so why change it?

Because you are not alone in this world.
Entire countries suffer from this system because they are enslaved by richer countries like Western Europe, China, and United States of America.
They are not the only ones, but the main ones to abuse from other countries.
By this I do not mean that the population of Western Europe, China, and United States of America are bad people, I just want to say that their governments and big corporations are responsible for this abuse.

The population of these wealthy countries are the mere reflection of the consumerist world we're living in today.
Some of these people live in ignorance, some are just fully indoctrinated by their societyâ€™s propaganda, and some live in the uncomfortable position of knowing what their government and big corporations perpetrate and feeling powerless to these acts.

The reason of this change becomes clear when you focus on every details of our world instead of simply following orders to look at the poor countries as "barbarian countries" and "useless countries" because they "deserved it".

## What is Akyanet?

Akyanet is a new society based on the anarcho-communist ideology.
Many fear the words "communism" and "anarchism" because of their current connation.
Let us take the first word, "communism". According to Wikipedia:
> Communism is a philosophical, social, political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic orderstructured upon **the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.**

This is pretty different from the totalitarian dictatorship many people think.
This misnamed definition perhaps originates from [McCarthyism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism) or the global fear of communism caused by the USSR and the cold war.
Basically, this propaganda from the past is having a long-lasting effect on the word "communism".

Unfortunately, this is not the only word suffering from misnaming. Let us take the case of "anarchism".
As for the previous word, here is the definition from Wikipedia:
> Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is **sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy**.
> Anarchism calls for the **abolition of the state, which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful**.
> It is usually described alongside libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing (libertarian socialism) of the socialist movement and as having a historical association with anti-capitalism and socialism.

And the popular definition could be expressed simply by "the abolition of all rules, chaos; Confusion and disorder". But this is a confusion with [anomie](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anomie). Wiktionary:
> Alienation or social instability caused by erosion of standards and values.

Now that you have the correct definitions, we can define what is the purpose of Akyanet.

## The goals of Akyanet

Akyanet has many goals and they will evolve over time, so we will list a few foundamental ones.

"Better" should no longer mean "more profitable", it should just stick to its original definition. i.e. "To surpass in excellence; to exceed; to excel.".
In Akyanet, it could also mean improving the social welfare.

Everyone should be equal.
This means nobody should be oppressed, discriminated, or prevented from taking part in the development of Akyanet.

Hierarchies must be prohibited **except** when they are vital.
For example, on a ship, there must be a captain to give orders as for piloting the ship correctly.
But the captain must be aware that he is not in a position of power.
This means that the captain could also do some chores on the ship if it does not compromise the safety of the people on board.

We must seek to achieve total autonomy within Akyanet.
Which means that the community is able to give appropriate housing for everyone, food, electricity, running water, heating, internet, health services, etc. without external help.
But it does not mean that we should isolate from people that are not part of Akyanet.

Money should be abolished because it will become obsolete (we will talk about that in next chapters).

Art should remain art. In our current capitalist society, art is worthless except if you can sell it.
And to sell it, it must become a product and not art.
Imagine being a talented painter that can paint magnificent landscapes but with your own style and also know how to paint with a style similar to Picasso, but you do not like painting this way.
Well, within the capitalist society, since your own style does not matter, you will be forced to make Picasso-like paintings because you cannot live off your own style.

Ecology must be a priority. Unsustainable energy must be prohibited except for research purposes.

## How Akyanet works

In this chapter, we will talk about how Akyanet is organized. But keep in mind that it could evolve over time if the members democratically decide to change the organisation.

### Districts, communes, and union of communes

Let us begin by districts.
A district is a group of 150 people maximum to prevent social isolation.
Exceptions can be made when, for example, you have a 152 people living near each other but are far from other groups of people.

A commune is a union of districts.
Preferably geographicaly near one another.
Communes are limited to 10000 people but as for the districts, there can be exceptions, and this limit can change over time.

Unions of communes are... unions of communes, obviously.
As for the communes, it is preferable that they are geographicaly near one another.
Unions of communes are not limited in population.

### Joining a district and social contract

You can join a district whenever you want.
There are no prerequisites for joining a district.

When you want to join a district, you will need to establish a contract with people responsible for this task (which are chosen democratically by the district members, so it could be the district council, an individual, or the whole district. It is entirely up to the district).
This contract, called the social contract, will describe what the district guarantees to you (housing, food, etc.) and what you guarantee to give to the district (performing essential tasks, etc.).

The social contract must respect the rules defined by the Global Coordinator (more on that later).
Additional terms of the contract are to be defined when establishing the contract.

### Essential tasks

In every commune or district, depending on their geographical situation, random members or all members depending on the number of tasks will be asked to perform certain tasks (for example, cleaning the streets, taking out the trash, ...) according to their social contract.

Members can ask to have another task attributed to them but they must understand that every task is essential and if they slightly dislike their attributed task, it is not really a good reason to ask for another attribution.
But coercive forces must be avoided, so the commune or the district will have to make sure that everyone knows why they are doing these tasks and how they are essential.

If two members agree on exchanging their tasks, it is up to the district/commune council to decide if they can do it without prior authorization from the district/commune council.
This authorization is sometimes needed to be sure that the members know how to perform their task.
But as always, coercive forces must be avoided at all costs.

It is up to the district to choose how and when the tasks will be attributed.

If a district does not have enough people to perform all essential tasks, the district can ask for help from the commune.

### Politics

Each district have a district council which is in charge of representing the district at the communal level.
The representatives are elected by the district using [Schulze STV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_STV) and they have a 3 month mandate.
Representatives can be revoked at any time if the majority (50% + 1) of the district members vote to.

The role of a representative is to represent the interests of a district and to explain to its district what the subjects were at the commune, what they will vote in the next weeks, etc.
The representatives cannot vote on behalf of the district, instead, all the commune members will vote.
Any subject (change in communal rules, tasks organisation, ...) is passed only if the majority (50% + 1) of the commune members vote for.

Unions of communes works in the same way.
But instead of electing representatives in each district, representatives will be elected in each commune by the commune members using [Schulze STV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_STV).

This means that districts cannot choose representatives if they have a population of less than 3 people.
In this case, all the district population are their own representatives.

Everyone can spectate the communal council meetings and the meetings of the union of communes.

Regularly organising meetings with the district and its representatives is strongly advised.

### Justice

If a member violates the district rules, the communal rules, the rules of the union of communes, or the rules of the Global Coordinator, he will be assigned to a psychological or medical intervention depending on the rule that has been violated.

If you see a member violating a rule, you can report it to the social workers of the commune or to one of the assigned associations for this task.

If you have a problem with another member but it is not governed by the local rules, you can either talk about your problem to members of your district and/or to the local social workers to solve your problem quickly by finding common ground, but if this does not work, you can submit your case to one of the assigned associations for this task.

In cases of recidivism, violent actions, etc., emergency response teams can be dispatched to prevent the problematic member to harm other members.
Then, the district or commune (if the district refuses to take the case) where the member is living can decide the fate of his social contract and if he need a psychological or medical intervention, if he need to understand more about something (social workers will take care of this), or, in extreme cases, if hee need to be kicked from his district/commune/union of commune or even Akyanet.

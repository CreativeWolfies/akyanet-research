## Introduction

The purpose of Akyanet is to be a better society and an accessible one.
This will never be a perfect society because that does not exist.
But we can try to go as close as possible to this utopia.

-----

## Our world and our society

### What's wrong?

Actually, a lot.
The ubiquity of the money for example.
Money gives power.
And this power is concentrated in hands of a few people.
It causes gaps between people and makes us go straight into the wall.
Corruption exists primarily because of money.

Money is not the only problem.
There are also [weapons of mass destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction), war, unfair justice, lack of equality, etc.
We live in a world where the rich gets richer, the poor gets poorer, and the middle class struggles to be part of the so-called "bourgeoisie" in the hope of feeling better.
There is something wrong about this system.
We dream of becoming rich to obtain the things we appreciate.
And to achieve this, our current society suggests that we must compete against others and abandon the ones at the bottom because they "deserved it."

### I'm fine with this system, so why change it?

Because you are not alone in this world.
Entire countries suffer from this system because they are enslaved by richer countries like Western Europe, China, and United States of America.
They are not the only ones, but the main ones to abuse from other countries.
By this I do not mean that the populations of Western Europe, China, and United States of America are the culprits, I just want to say that their governments and big corporations are responsible for this abuse.

The populations of these wealthy countries are the mere reflection of the consumerist world we're living in today.
Some of these people live in ignorance, are fully indoctrinated by their societyâ€™s propaganda, or live in the uncomfortable position of knowing what their government and big corporations perpetrate and feeling powerless to these acts.

The reason of this change becomes clear when you focus on every detail of our world instead of simply following orders to look at the poor countries as "barbarian countries" and "useless countries" because they "deserved it."

## What is Akyanet?

Akyanet is a new society based on the anarcho-communist ideology.
Many fear the words "communism" and "anarchism" because of their current connotation.
Let us take the first word, "communism." According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism):
> Communism is a philosophical, social, political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic order structured upon **the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.**

This is pretty different from the totalitarian dictatorship many people think about when hearing that word.
This misnamed definition perhaps originates from [McCarthyism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism) or the global fear of communism caused by the USSR and the cold war.
In other words, this propaganda from the past is producing a persistent effect on the word "communism."

Unfortunately, this is not the only word suffering from misnaming. Let us take the case of "anarchism."
As for the previous word, here is the definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism):
> Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is **sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy**.
> Anarchism calls for the **abolition of the state, which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful**.
> It is usually described alongside libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing (libertarian socialism) of the socialist movement and as having a historical association with anti-capitalism and socialism.

However, the popular definition could be expressed simply by "the abolition of all rules, chaos; confusion and disorder." But this is a common confusion between anarchism and [anomie](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anomie). Wiktionary defines "anomie" as such:
> Alienation or social instability caused by erosion of standards and values.

Now that you have the accurate definitions, we can define what is the purpose of Akyanet.

## The goals of Akyanet

Akyanet has many goals, and they will evolve over time.
We are going to list a few fundamental ones.

"Better" should no longer mean "more profitable", it should just stick to its original definition. I.e. "To surpass in excellence; to exceed; to excel."
In Akyanet, it could also mean improving the social welfare.

Everyone should be equal.
This means nobody should be oppressed, discriminated, or prevented from taking part in the development of Akyanet.

Hierarchies must be prohibited **except** when they are vital.
For example, on a ship, there must be a captain to give orders as for navigating the ship correctly.
But the captain must be aware that he is not in a position of power.
This means the captain should also do some chores on the ship as long as it does not compromise the safety of the people on board.

We must seek to achieve total autonomy within Akyanet.
Which means that the community is able to provide appropriate housing for everyone, food, electricity, running water, heating, internet, health services, etc. without external help.
But it does not mean we should isolate from people that are not part of Akyanet.

Money should be abolished because it will become obsolete.

Art should remain art. In our current capitalist society, art is worthless except if you can sell it.
And to sell it, it must become a product and not art.
Imagine being a talented painter that can depict magnificent landscapes but with your own, exotic style and also know how to paint with a style similar to Picasso, but you do not like painting this way.
Well, within the capitalist society, since your own style does not matter, you will be forced to make Picasso-like paintings because you cannot live off your own style.

Ecology must be a priority. Unsustainable energy must be prohibited except for research purposes.

## How Akyanet works

In this chapter, we will talk about how Akyanet is organized. But keep in mind that it could evolve over time if the members democratically decide to change the organisation.

### Districts, communes, and unions of communes

Let us begin by districts.
A district is a group of 150 people maximum to prevent social isolation.
Exceptions can be made when, for example, you have a 152 people living near each other but are far from other groups of people.

A commune is a union of districts.
Preferably geographically close to each other.
Communes are limited to 10,000 people but as for the districts, there can be exceptions, and this limit can change over time.

Unions of communes are... unions of communes, obviously.
As for the communes, it is preferable that they are geographically near one another.
Unions of communes are not limited in population.

### Joining a district, leaving a district, and the social contract

You can join a district whenever you want.
There are no prerequisites for joining a district.

When you want to join a district, you will need to establish a contract with people responsible for this task (Which are chosen democratically by the district members, so it could be the district council, an individual, or the whole district. It is completely up to the district).
This contract, called the social contract, will describe what the district guarantees to you (housing, food, etc.) and what you guarantee to give to the district (performing essential tasks, etc.).

The social contract must respect the rules defined by the Global Coordinator (more on that later).
Additional terms of the contract are to be defined when establishing the contract.

You retain the right to leave your district, your commune, and your union of communes whenever you want.

### Essential tasks

In every commune or district, depending on their geographical situation, random members or all members, depending on the number of tasks, will be asked to perform certain tasks (for example, cleaning the streets, taking out the trash, ...) according to their social contract.

Members can ask to have another task attributed to them, but they must understand that every task is essential and if they slightly dislike their attributed task, it is not really a sufficient reason to ask for another attribution.
But coercive forces must be avoided, so the commune or the district will have to make sure everyone knows why they are doing these tasks and how they are essential.

If two members agree on exchanging their tasks, it is up to the district/commune council to decide if they can do it without prior authorization from the district/commune council.
This authorization is sometimes required to be sure that the members know how to perform their task.
But as always, coercive forces must be avoided at all costs.

It is up to the district to choose how and when the tasks will be attributed.

Given tasks should be adapted to each individual according to their work and their capabilities.
For example, students will be given tasks relative to the subjects they are studying so that they can improve their education while helping the community by performing essential tasks.

If a district does not have enough people to perform all essential tasks, the district can request help from other Akyanet entities (communes, unions of communes, ...).

### Politics

Each Akyanet entity (districts, communes, unions of communes) has a council where representatives of districts come to discuss about various subjects.
These representatives are chosen by the concerned entities' members (e.g. districts for the commune council).

It is up to the people to choose the way of "electing" their representatives.
It means that a district could choose that any member who wants to be a representative can be one like other districts could choose to elect their representatives using a defined voting system (for instance, [Schulze STV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_STV)).

The representatives can be revoked at any time by the represented if the majority (50% + 1) are for.
The mandate duration is fixed to 3-month. (This mandate duration can evolve over time.)

The goal of these representatives is not to vote on behalf of the represented (since it does not work), but to represent the interests of the represented by debating, discussing, and arguing over multiple subjects to come with suggestions of "rules" that the represented will vote on to know whether or not they agree to the suggestion.
These suggestions should, as much as possible, be based on facts and studies.
These same facts and studies should also be [peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) to prevent the distortion of real events.

Discussions and debates within the councils should be accessible to everyone and thus, recorded and broadcasted accordingly.

Councils are advised to debate with people concerned by the subjects that are being treated (e.g. railway workers when debating over a subject concerning railways).

Regularly organizing meetings with the district and its representatives is strongly advised.

Any representative can choose to leave his role of representative before his mandate's end.
In such case, if the Akyanet entity does not have other representatives left, a new representative should be found as soon as possible.

### Justice

If a member violates the district rules, the communal rules, the rules of the union of communes, or the rules of the Global Coordinator, he will be assigned to a psychological or medical intervention depending on the rule that has been violated.

If you see a member violating a rule, you can report it to the social workers of the commune or to one of the assigned associations for this task.

If you have a problem with another member but it is not governed by the local rules, you can either talk about your problem to members of your district and/or to the local social workers to solve your problem quickly by finding common ground, but if this does not work, you can submit your case to one of the assigned associations for this task.

In cases of recidivism, violent actions, etc., emergency response teams can be dispatched to prevent the problematic member to harm other members.
Then, the district or commune (if the district refuses to take the case) where the member is living can decide the fate of his social contract and if he needs a psychological or medical intervention, if he needs to understand more about something (Social workers will take care of this.), or, in extreme cases, if he needs to be kicked from his district/commune/union of commune, or even Akyanet.
But you must remember that coercive forces must be avoided.

Laws and rules shall be made in a minimal way.
The shall be understandable and atomic.
Enforcing these laws and rules should be made carefully and by cooperating with social workers as well as scientists and others.

### Global Coordinator

The Global Coordinator, abbreviated GC, is a group of representatives, emergency response teams' representatives, professionals, experts, and individuals.
It can be thought as the council for the whole Akyanet community.

The members of the GC are all revokable.

Everyone can join the Global Coordinator.
But the "managers" (the ones who will dispatch the work) of the Global Coordinator are exactly like a council, in fact, it is the council of the whole Akyanet community.
Therefore, the members of the council should be elected by the voting method that the community has chosen.
It could be random selection, STV, FPTP, or whatever the community chooses.
This method is chosen before the â€” maybe optional â€” elections using [Schulze STV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_STV) voting.
The members of the council have a 3-month mandate, like the councils of other Akyanet entities.
The same rules are applied.

The list of methods of election for the GC can be updated (adding a new method to the list) using the GC's to do list.

The purpose of the Global Coordinator is to solve major problems or to redirect problems to the right entities.

The to-do list is a priority queue that can be found online.
This means everyone can submit a task to the list, but they must have a certain number of upvotes to have a greater priority.

Tasks with less than 100 upvotes within 100 days from the day of the day of the task's submission will be removed from the queue.
They can also be removed if the task have more than 100 downvotes within 50 days from the day of the task's submission.

These numbers will evolve depending of the number of members in Akyanet.

If the same task is added to the queue within 50 days from the removal of the task, it will be instantly removed from the queue.

When submitting a task, it has, by default, 0 upvotes.
As a reminder, one upvote plus one downvote = 0.

The Global Coordinator also defines the rules that everyone must respect.
To add, remove, or change one of these rules, you will need to submit a task about this in the Global Coordinator to-do list (priority queue) , then, the Global Coordinator will organize a vote where the entire community of Akyanet will participate.
The subject of the vote is passed if the majority (50% + 1) of the community voted for.

Rules are something that we should avoid.
Instead, these rules should become social habits.

### Voting

Voting is pretty difficult to implement.
This is why this version of this document is not precise about every case (for example, in case of major health issues (Pandemics, ...)) and how they should be handled.

You have the right to vote if you are a member of Akyanet and you are 15 years old or older.
But in the long term, even non-members should be able to vote.

*PhirosWolf's note*:
> I'm not an expert on every subject, so if you have an idea of how this document could be more precise and/or cover more subjects, you could always help me to complete this document.

When talking about majority in voting and writing `(50% + 1)` next to it, it means 50% of the concerned community plus one vote is necessary to define it as the majority.

### Associations

In Akyanet, the freedom of association is fully guaranteed.
To put simply, the freedom of association is the right to associate (form groups) with other people.
Here is the definition of the [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/freedom_of_association):
> The right of citizens to come together with other individuals and collectively express, promote, pursue and defend common interests.

Associations can be pretty useful in Akyanet because they can bring together people with the same interests such as, for example, programming, drawing, and much more.

Everyone can create an association at any time.

An association is dissolved when it has zero members left.

An association can be a group of people sharing one or multiple common goals, but it could also be similar to a community, where new members can talk with more experienced members relative to the community's topic.

You can join and leave an association as you like.
You can even join multiple associations.

As for districts, you are free to leave an association whenever you want.

### Work

In Akyanet, the 20-hour week will be established (4h per day for 5 days).
You are free to organize your work days, like, instead of 4 hours per day for 5 days, you could do 8h per day for 2 days followed by 4 hours of work the next day.

In some cases, the work week can be longer.
For instance, emergency response teams will have longer work weeks.
But, in compensation, they can be exempted from essential tasks if they want to.

"Work" consists of doing essential tasks and/or tasks related to your profession.
Education is also considered as work.

For instance, you might be a mason and you are part of the association for masonry.
In this case, your work will perhaps be to build the foundations of a new home or to discuss with the association about how the homes could be improved.

In case you are not part of an association, you could either join one, work for communes or individuals, or work for yourself and then give the product of your work to the community.

The production must match the demand of the given product.
If the production is greater than the demand, we have to make sure that it does not impact ecology directly (e.g. CO2 emissions) or indirectly (e.g. higher power consumption may emit more CO2 because of the power plant's CO2 emissions.) or impact social relationships, etc.
Therefore, if the impact is non-existent or positive (positive as in "positive for the ecology", not "an impact greater than zero") , then overproduction is authorized but not necessarily advised (in case of non-existent impact).
This means that, before overproducing, the concerned associations and workers must really think about if it is really necessary.

In case the production is not sufficient to cover demand, we have multiple solutions:
- Lower the demand by finding an alternative product.
- Increase the production by asking districts, communes, or unions of communes to help in creating more means of production, improving the production process, or finding workers interested in working full time or part time in this field of production (without using coercive forces, as always).
- Using external sources to compensate the difference between production and demand. (This solution should be avoided to improve autonomy.)

The work week could be shortened if the production is sufficient.

If you are between 14 and 18 years old, you have the right to work and do essential tasks but only on a voluntary basis.
Forcing someone under 18 years old is strictly prohibited because it is considered as child labour.
The only exception is education.

The rest of the week is dedicated to leisure.
We will talk about that later.

### Agreements

An agreement could be thought as a contract, but without the state policing behind it.

In an agreement, you state the parties of the contract, the current date, and what each parties want from the other parties.
Then, the parties to the agreement can sign it and distribute a copy to each party for extra verifiability.
This could also be done by creating the agreement online (on the Akyanet website).

Agreements should not be the main to exchange services.
They are just tools for long-term services or just to keep track of what services you have to do.

Members of Akyanet must understand that trust is fundamental.

Changing or revoking an agreement after concluding it is possible if all the involved parties consent to it.

If a member is found to abuse the trust of others, social workers or workers in the domain of psychology and/or medicine will take his case.
In extreme forms of abuse, the justice system will take his case.

Akyanet members should be aware that some members cannot provide or do not need to provide a counterpart for an agreement.
For instance, some disabled people are unable to work, but this does not that should be left apart.
Farmers, ERTs, and other people which have a longer work week do not necessarily need to give a counterpart since everyone benefits from their work.

This is why we must tend towards a gift culture, because everyone is contributing to the social welfare and thus, nobody should need to work more to compensate counterparts of various agreements.

### Gifts

If you have a product which is not useful for you anymore or because you produced it with a view to offering it as a gift, you can give it to an individual, an association, and any other entities within Akyanet (Districts, communes, ...).

The website of Akyanet will also provide a way of gifting via an online and/or real-life [give-away shop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give-away_shop).
This online give-away shop will have some rules to prevent people from acquiring all at the same time.

Here are some ideas for these rules:
- Random selection for products with insufficient quantities.
- Queued limited wish lists (The one which waited the most for a product gets it first. The wish list has a limited number of products you can wait for).
- "First come, first served."

Maybe there can be multiple online or real-life give-away shops.

In the long term, we must tend towards a gift culture.

### Leisure

With the 20-hour work week, leisure will take a bigger place in life.
If your passion is art, then you will be able to experiment with your style of art, discuss and cooperate with members of associations for art.
Leisure is vital for individual development so that you can understand more about yourself, your environment, and how you could contribute to the society.

Unfortunately, the capitalist society is a place where leisure is considered as useless or a mean of exploitation.
When considered as useless, your work time will overflow on your only free time, the week-end.
When considered as a mean of exploitation, you will be employed for your passion so that they can profit from your voluntary, forced, or secretly forced ([Crunch culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer#Crunch_time)) overtime.

As Pyotr Kropotkin said,
> After bread has been secured, leisure is the supreme aim.

### Holidays

Since a lot of holidays are related to religious events, they indirectly indoctrinate children because the children parents will probably have to remind, every time these holidays occur, the origin of this holiday.

This is why these holidays will be abolished and replaced by new holidays.

These new holidays will be related to historical events including, but not limited to, general strikes, important anarcho-communist events, days where significant progress in science has been made, etc.

Holidays will become fully indicative.
This means that you will not be automatically exempted from your work and your essential tasks.
Some holidays will still require essential tasks to be done, while others will not.

If you want to take off days for these holidays or for other occasions, you are free to do so.
But you must remember that working is vital for the community.

If you are part of one or multiple associations, you will, maybe, have to find a common ground with your coworkers to organize your work and when you will take off days.

### Emergency Response Teams (ERTs)

Emergency response teams are groups of people in charge of emergencies (fires, violence, health emergencies).
Their role is to guarantee the security of the community and its well-being.

Since they have such an important role, they can ask for essential tasks exemption so that they can react quickly in case of an emergency.

This kind of teams can only be organized by a commune or a union of communes.

These teams are fully autonomous.
But in the case of militias, the use of their firearms should be closely monitored.

The composition of these teams is based on voluntary service.

ERTs' equipment is given by Akyanet (the organizer entity if they have enough equipment or other Akyanet entities (districts, communes, unions of communes, associations)).

These teams are not limited to the borders of its organizer entity.
They could even help people outside Akyanet.

Since ERTs are autonomous, they can choose how they organize themselves, for instance, by creating a pseudo-hierarchy (choosing democratically the one to give orders, etc.).

As for hierarchies, these pseudo-hierarchies must be justifiable.

Below is a list of some vital ERTs, but there could be new teams.
For example, an ERT can be created for managing road traffic or enforcing road traffic laws.

#### Fire

The role of the emergency response teams for fire, or ERTsF in short, is to prevent uncontrollable fires and to extinguish them.

As for militias, there are multiple types of ERTsF, but each ERTF is in charge of organizing these groups.

#### Militias

The role of the militias is to protect people from violent people.

We can distinguish multiple types of militias:

Name | Are in charge of... | Have access to...
-----|---------------------|------------------
Border militias | Protecting Akyanet borders if and only if the country sharing the border is threatening military intervention or any other violent and/or armed conflict/intervention | Heavy protection, heavy weapons, fire arms, non-lethal weapons
Emergency response teams for extreme violence (ERTsEV) | Protecting people from an extremely violent group or from extremely violent individuals | Heavy protection, fire arms and non-lethal weapons
Emergency response teams for violence (ERTsV) | Protecting people from violent groups and violent individuals | Classical protection, non-lethal weapons and, in some cases, fire arms and heavy protection

Every militia that have access to lethal weapons must be closely monitored so that they do not use these weapons against themselves or against non-threatening people.
If a militia uses their lethal weapons against non-threatening people, ERTsEV or members of border militias will be sent to retrieve the lethal weapons.

Border militias and ERTsEV have the right to kill.
**This right must only be used if any other non-lethal solution cannot be used at all**.

All militias must respect all Geneva Conventions and all of its additional protocols.
And since militias are autonomous, they could agree on additional rules.

**Peace is precious**, so border militias must not shoot first, not provoke, etc.
Peace measures must be strictly applied.
All militias are in charge of promoting peace, not war.

*PhirosWolf's note*:
> I strongly insist on this point: peace is precious.
> So DO NOT spoil it stupidly.
> I don't want Akyanet to have blood on its hands.

#### Health

The role of the emergency response teams for health (ERTsH) is to help people who are in life-threatening health emergencies or to help people who need medical care quickly.

As for militias, there are multiple types of ERTsH (Nurses, paramedics, ...), but each ERTH is in charge of organizing these groups.

#### Civil protection

The role of the emergency response teams for civil protection (ERTsCP) is to help people in case of a disaster.
This help can take many forms such as helping them to move to shelter.

As for militias, there are multiple types of ERTsCP, but each ERTCP is in charge of organizing these groups.

### Postal services

Postal services in Akyanet will be guaranteed by voluntaries.

We could imagine a system with an online register that could create the path of the parcels/letters.
Every voluntary who is part of the given route will give the parcels and/or letters to the next node of the route by his own means.

### Education

In Akyanet, education is free and studying is considered as work.

We can distinguish two phases of education: Compulsory education (from 5/6 years old to 15/16 years old) and higher education.

It is strongly advised that children from 5/6 years old to 15/16 years old go to school so that they can have a basic knowledge in multiple domains.

If one child needs home schooling (Because he asked to or the social workers noticed it.) , then the parents will be asked if they can and want to teach their child or if they need someone that can do this work.

In case the parents teach to their child, the parents will receive lessons about how to teach to children.

Another alternative for home schooling is online teaching.

In our current society, compulsory education aims at teaching basic knowledge the same way for everyone.
This is wrong (see [this video](https://youtu.be/dqTTojTija8) to better understand why).

Education should teach basic knowledge to everyone, but the teaching method can be different from one person to another.

We should stop making overcrowded classes.

If a child or an adult has facilities with his education, he can get along with his teachers to ask them if he can skip a grade.

Exams should be removed except in one case: if the courses you take are related to a risky work field (doctor of medicine, train conductor, nuclear power plant operator, etc.) or a work field needing long education (doctors, etc.).
In this case, an exam can be organized at the end of each year, at the end of your courses, or before major events (e.g. Passing an exam to know if you are able to operate research nuclear reactors).
Certificates can be given to students after their final exam.

Entrance exams and prerequisite certificates limitations are tolerated if they are justifiable.

Schools should stop putting limitations (like minimum age) on entrance exams.

Schools do not necessarily need to be ran by professional teachers.
These kinds of teachers are a great way to expend the fields covered by education.
This means domains considered as hobbies in our current society (e.g. cosplaying) could be covered by a real and free education and will finally be recognized as a real work.
Basically, the same features as [folk high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_high_school#Features).

*PhirosWolf's note*:
> The system I aim is an education where everyone could learn what he wants and with meaningful explanations and exercises.

### Public transports

Public transports are organized by associations.

Most of the conductors/pilots will have to be certificated in order to reduce the risk of accidents.

Public transports are really important if we want to progress towards a zero carbon footprint.

### Public facilities

Public facilities are places dedicated to accomplish a given task.

For example, general use halls, public workbenches (tools exchange), etc. are public facilities.

Some of them, like the general use halls, can be reserved by individuals or by groups for certain dates.

### Medias

[Freedom of the press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press), [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech), and [freedom of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information) will be guaranteed.

[Fact-checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking) is important.
All medias will be strongly advised to add a kind of fact-checking score that can clearly be seen on each article/each news so that people can quickly see the veracity of the article/news to prevent [media manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_manipulation).
This fact-checking score can be determined by computing the average of the scores given by fact-checking associations.

In case of a very low fact-checking score or in case of an article talking about a sensitive subject (Suicide, racism, violence, ...) , a banner could be added next to the article to help the readers understand the context of what they are reading, what they should watch out for, and why this specific article has this banner and this low score.

To create a media, you just need to create an association for it.

We could imagine an association of all media associations to create and update regularly media guidelines to provide advises about how to prevent biases, how to deal with sensitive subjects, etc.

### Housing

Appropriate housing should be given to everyone.

The best would be to have common rooms (kitchen, toilets, living room) and one personal room per person.

"But what about the luxury houses?" you might ask.
Well, for now, housing will depend on the houses inside your district.
But I am aware that this is not a good solution, so we should find a fairer solution.

I think we need to make villages and cities autonomous.
To do that, we should make villages grow and decrease the size of cities.
We should also improve the number of public spaces and green spaces, as well as the architecture and the organization of cities and villages.
Once this is done, a more equal housing system can take place.

Maintenance of the houses and apartments are done by their occupants or by specialized people in cases of serious damages/problems.

### Joining and leaving Akyanet

Depending on the phase Akyanet is currently in, you can join Akyanet by various means.

One of the easiest is via the Akyanet website.
Later, Akyanet you will be able to join Akyanet by mail.

When joining, you will need to fill a registration form for the creation of your Akyanet ID Card and for your online Akyanet account.

If you want to leave Akyanet, you can do so by the same means available for joining (online or, later, by mail).
By doing so, your Akyanet ID Card will be revoked and your online Akyanet account will be deleted.
Before leaving, you might want to organize with the associations you joined and with the people you concluded agreements with.

To prevent abuse when creating agreements, they are advised to check the seniority of the parties they are concluding the agreement with.

### Akyanet ID Card

The Akyanet ID Card is a card containing information about yourself to "prove" to people outside Akyanet that you are a member of Akyanet.

Here is a list of the pieces of information the Akyanet ID Card might contain:
- Name (the one you choose to have in Akyanet, not necessarily your real name)
- Date of birth
- Registration date
- [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
- Profile picture (optional)
- Signature

The name, profile picture, and signature can be changed at any time.

The profile picture could be your real face, a drawing, a picture, or anything you want.
You just have to avoid using pictures that could harm people.

### Commitees

Commitees can be created and appointed by any council.

The purpose of a council is to handle specific tasks.

As for councils, their members usually have a 3-month mandate and they are revokable.
These commitees should work closely with the council which appointed them and the data they collect should be public to make this council as transparent as possible.

## About

### Family

Parents need to understand that their children are not their property even though they are responsible for their actions until they are considered as adults (18 years old).
This means that parents need to cooperate with their children, not limiting their children with their (parents) sets of ideas.

I can understand that parents seek to protect their children against bad influence, but by doing so, some of them end up protecting them against good things without knowing it or without acknowledging it.

I am not saying that parents should let their children do anything they want, I am just saying that they should find the right balance between protection and laissez-faire.

If children have problems with their parents or the other way around, social workers are here to help.

### Religion

Freedom of religion is guaranteed within Akyanet, but I think that religion has a bad influence over people by instilling them a fixed way to think and/or to analyze situations.

A majority of religions are, by their holy books, against the most fundamental anarcho-communist ideas, such as liberty and equality.

As an example, in the Bible, we can read this:
> [...] Because **the Israelites are my servants** (1), whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.
> Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but **fear your God** (2).
> **Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves** (3).
> **You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property** (4).
> **You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life** (5), but **you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly** (6).
> If a foreigner residing among you becomes rich and any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to the foreigner or to a member of the foreignerâ€™s clan, they retain the right of redemption after they have sold themselves. [...]

1. Hierarchy.
2. Hierarchy and fear of the upper class.
3. Slavery.
4. Slavery.
5. Slavery.
6. Discrimination, therefore, infringing equality.

This quote is said by God himself at Leviticus 25:42-48 and the phrasing is from the New International Version of the Bible found on [biblestudytools.com](https://www.biblestudytools.com/).
This is just an example.
Other holy books and scriptures contain similar infringements of liberty and equality.

Theists and deists should not let their faith influence their decision-making process to prevent [magical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking) and to promote [rational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality).
I know that it will be difficult for them to against their faith in some cases, and for some of them, it will be impossible.
But it is vital for them to understand why rationality is more important than their religion.

In Akyanet territory, parishes, churches, cathedrals, and all other religious buildings will become public facilities.
Theists and deists can still use these places if they find common ground with other people wanting to use these places.

In Akyanet, religious indoctrination should be avoided.

### Borders

Borders within Akyanet are defined by Akyanet entities (districts, communes, unions of communes).
These borders are **only** for administrative purposes, not for creating rivalries between members of Akyanet entities.

[Freedom of movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement) is guaranteed between inside borders.

Borders between Akyanet and other nations should, as far as possible, remain open.

In the case of dangerous borders (where the neighboring nation is threatening Akyanet) , people can still cross the border if they come without the intent of doing harm to other people.
In some cases, dangerous borders can be closed if closing the border is the best solution for everyone even if it is not recommended.

One of the disadvantages of having open borders is that spies can come and go as they like in Akyanet.
If the only goal of these spies is to gather information about Akyanet, they will be disappointed since the freedom of information is guaranteed, therefore, all pieces of information about Akyanet actions are open.
But spies' goals are not limited to gathering information.
If they come from a threatening nation, maybe their goals will be to cause panic and confusion, or infiltrate militias to provoke immoral actions in the name of Akyanet to let their home nation to declare war to Akyanet.

This problem must be fixed by Akyanet when this becomes a real problem.

### Advertising

Advertising will not exist since everyone is able to get products from associations at their right value.

Advertising comes with competition, the opposite of cooperation, therefore, the opposite of Akyanet.

### Marriage and relationships

Marriage will be abolished because, in our current society, it is only a way to apply new rules over two people such as taxes.
Marriage is also a source of discrimination by its religious origin.

Instead, every individual must be free to choose with whom he wants to unite.
This kind of relationship needs the consent of each party.

Obviously, you cannot create a relationship with a minor (child) under 16.
Parties thinking about creating a relationship with a high age difference are advised to think carefully about it.

Since you are free to form the relationships you want.
[Polyamorous relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory) are implicitly authorized, but every partner should be informed of the other relations and must consent to it.

### Gender, gender identity, and sexuality

There is no such thing as "man" and "woman."
These terms are [social constructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructionism), which means that this notion of "man" and "woman" is a norm induced by our current society.

These terms are problematic because, in the first place, do you give the term "man" or "woman" to an intersex person? (if you apply these terms in terms of their sex). And what about people who do not feel like a man or woman? (if you apply these terms in terms of their feelings).
This is why the Akyanet ID Card does not contain your gender.

You are free to choose your gender identity and your sexuality, since it is something completely personal.

But as everything, use your common sense.
Therefore, pedophilia, zoophilia, etc., are not allowed since it cannot guarantee a pure consensus between parties.

Since the terms "man" and "woman" are obsolete, "mister", "miss", "sir", "ma'am", ..., are also obsolete.
Instead, it is recommended to use a neutral title like "comrade."

### Akyanet development

Akyanet will evolve with its population.

We can divide the development of Akyanet in multiple phases:

1. Akyanet will have few members, and most of the members' needs cannot be fulfilled by Akyanet. Joining Akyanet will require the approval of the founders or people assigned to this task.
2. Akyanet will still have few members, but more than before. Some of the members' needs can be fulfilled by Akyanet. Joining Akyanet will still require the approval of the founders or people assigned to this task, but the entry criteria will accept more people into Akyanet.
3. Akyanet will begin to have districts, thus more members. More of the members' needs can be fulfilled by Akyanet. The entry criteria will accept even more people in.
4. Akyanet will begin to have communes, thus more members. More of the members' needs can be fulfilled by Akyanet. The entry criteria will accept almost all people in.
5. Akyanet will begin to have more communes, maybe unions of communes. Essential needs can be fulfilled by Akyanet. The entry criteria will accept almost all people in.
6. Akyanet can fulfill basic needs for everyone. The entry criteria will be removed.
7. Akyanet can fulfill more needs for everyone.
8. Akyanet can fulfill almost all needs for everyone.
9. Akyanet can fulfill all needs for everyone.
10. Akyanet can fulfill all needs for everyone and Akyanet will be able to fulfill some needs for non-members.

Note that none of these phases mention a territory.

You can see that, in the first phases, there is a kind of "approval" system, which is in conflict with the no discrimination rule.
This approval system is just a way to temporarily protect Akyanet from dangerous people (e.g. fascists) which are trying to join Akyanet only to destroy it.
Obviously, this approval system will not last long and will require less and less criteria over time until this approval system is completely gone.
When this approval system has disappeared, it will mean that the social workers of Akyanet will be able to help these "dangerous" people understand their mistakes.

### Problems & Thoughts

#### From Tristan Gerber

During Akyanet's development, the capitalist governments probably will not stay still.
Here is a list of the current unsolved problems we are probably going to encounter:

1. Being a member of Akyanet â€” while in its first phases â€” means that you will do more and more for Akyanet while doing less and less for the government or any capitalist entities.
The governments will try to prevent people from joining Akyanet.
They could do so by giving them something or by restricting them.
If they do so by giving them money or something, no big deal, this would be seen as a loss of control, which will only bring more people into Akyanet, but there are few possibilities where they do so.
They would instead do mass anti-Akyanet propaganda, make some territory taxes which Akyanet users would find themselves unable to pay, pass some laws that would restrict Akyanet users from using anything the government have.
For example: public transport, health care, schooling and much more.
If a scenario like this occurs, the government could use the military to make these laws respected.
This would be even more of a problem in foreign countries where the government is omniscient and does not fear the people (China, Russia, ...).
Phones could also be controlled or restricted from Akyanet users by big corporations because they would see Akyanet members as non-profitable or dangerous for their business.

2. ((TODO))


Poor countries could be a good place to introduce Akyanet because people usually live closer one to another and already knows everyone in one's village.
The government also could not control the people too easily, and they would not have much to loose.
The problem is that they would eventually not have contact means due to poverty. This is also riskier because the government is more dangerous and will not hesitate to kill.


### Akyanet flag

The Akyanet flag (see Resources > Images) is a red and black flag (anarcho-communist flag) in the background with the Akyanet logo on top of it.

### Activism

Every member is free from joining activist groups in foreign countries.
But no one should pretend acting on behalf of Akyanet.

If, on rare occasions, the community of Akyanet strongly agrees on taking part in a protest, this same protest **must** be a peaceful one.

Protests in countries threatening Akyanet or threatening to use lethal weapons/[mass-destruction weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction) should be avoided.

### Propaganda

Propaganda posters for Akyanet can exist, but it must always be [objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalistic_objectivity), clearly show the source of the information, and the information must always be right (therefore, [peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review)).

These "propaganda" posters could show, for example, motivating messages for everyone.

The drawing or the things that are displayed on propaganda must not offense anyone.
It could denounce the acts of a company, but not the person running the company.

Propaganda cannot take form as censorship.

We should remember that, in these companies, the workers are almost forced to do what they are ordered to do, and the bosses are also forced to keep the competition going because more ruthless companies could make them bankrupt if they do not.

Propaganda will be used only to motivate people or helping them understand what some companies or nations are doing wrong, but arousing hate towards an individual or a group of individuals will never ever be the goal of Akyanet.

In other words, I do not think that the term "propaganda" applies for this kind of public information because all of the displayed information is factual and it do not seek to hide compromising informations.

### Diplomacy

As the population of Akyanet will start to grow, the need for diplomats will increase.

Diplomats are workers in charge of official relationships with other countries or communities.

They are appointed by the Akyanet members using [Schulze STV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_STV) for a 3-month mandate.

As for council members, they are revokable.

As diplomats, they need to cooperate closely to the GC to correctly represent the interests of the Akyanet community and to promote peace around the world.

### Patents and copyrights

In our current society, patents and copyrights are used to protect the revenue that the protected product generate.
But since Akyanet is a society without money, patents and copyrights becomes useless.

The issue with copyrights and patents is that they often slow down research.

This is why, in Akyanet, patents and copyrights are abolished.
Instead, licenses are used.

Licenses contain the name(s) of the creation's author(s) and the date of when it was created.
If someone brings changes to the original creation, he must provide a copy of the license with it.
This copied license should contain the original content of the license, a link to the original work if possible, and the name(s) of the changes' author(s) with, when possible, a short description of the changes and the date of the changes.

If a member pretends to be the original author of a creation when he is not, the real original author have multiple choices: he can discuss with the fake original author to try finding common ground, or he can report this abuse on the website to correct the license.

This licensing system is the one by default.
Meaning that if a creation does not have a license attached to it, if you make changes to it or you simply repost it, you have to mention the original creator, etc.

You cannot license anything.
The creation must be reasonably complex (e.g. you cannot license a color or a shape).

In some cases, you can limit the use of a creation.
For instance, if you create a logo for your association and you use it as a seal (to indicate the origin of some documents for example), you do not want someone else to use it as it could mislead some members.
In this situation, you have to mention the usage limitations in the license and you have to provide a valid justification of why you need these usage limitations.

### Akyanet website and its maintenance

The Akyanet website is an important part of Akyanet.
The goals of this website are to provide a personal space to Akyanet members, provide voting interfaces, forums, links to information sources, various tools, and much more.

The source code of the website must be open-source.

In the first phases, the Akyanet website will be hosted using a host which is not part of Akyanet.
But, when possible, we must host Akyanet on Akyanet host servers and decentralize Akyanet to reduce the risk of total destruction due to a server takedown.

The maintenance will be guaranteed by a commitee named Akyanet Website Maintenance Commitee, or AWMC in short.
Members of this commitee are appointed by the Global Coordinator.
All members of this commitee are revokable at any time.
They have a 3-month mandate.

All changes require the approval of all AWMC members.
These same changes, once approved by the AWMC, should be approved by the Global Coordinator, which could organize a vote involving the whole Akyanet community if needed.

Modifications and modification requests, including their current state and additional information about them (code, description, debates transcripts, ...), must be public.

The size of the commitee should be large enough to quickly apply the requested modifications and to reduce the risk of corruption.

A system of key-sharing between AWMC and the GC must be set up as soon as possibe to prevent the application of unwanted changes from the AWMC.
This system must prevent unilateral changes.

Additional commitees may be required to ensure the correct maintenance of the Akyanet website.

### Hunting

Hunting is an activity which have a negative impact on wildlife.
This is why, in Akyanet, we should avoid it, and maybe even prohibit it.

Animals deserve rights too.

Some exceptions can be made for hunting, for instance, invasive species can be hunted if they poses a threat to the wildlife equilibrium.
This kind of exceptional hunting must be closely monitored.

### Road traffic

We still need traffic rules to prevent accidents from happening.

Violation of these rules will result in interventions by social workers or by an ERT depending on the degree of violation.
We do not seek to create a hierarchy.
We only want to prevent road accidents.

### Narcotics and drugs

Narcotics can **only** be used for medical use (to help addicts get out of their addiction gradually).

Narcotics are prohibited if they create an addiction that can get out of control very quickly.
The ones that does not create addictions must not be sold and they must be reported and tracked precisely to prevent misusage.

The Akyanet Drugs and Narcotics Monitoring Commitee, or ADNMC in short, is in charge of monitoring the use and the location of narcotics and drugs.
This commitee is appointed by the Global Coordinator.
As for the AWMC, the members of this commitee have a 3-month mandate, they are revokable, and they must work closely with the GC.

The data collected by the ADNMC must be public.
The only exception to this rule is the location of the drugs and narcotics.
ERTs have the right to access this data in case of emergency.

Some associatons could work closely with the ADNMC so that they could research to create a **non-addictive** and **non-dangerous** mind-altering substance.
The point of doing this is to find an alternative to alcohol and other dangerous substances with the goal of making this new substance non-addictive and non-dangerous.
Creating a mind-altering substance as mentionned could reduce the number of deaths caused by alcohol and others.
Obviously this new substance should be monitored by the ADNMC to prevent misuse of it.

### Holding a meeting (for councils and commitees)

Meetings inside councils and commitees should be respectful and well-organized debates.

To do this, a moderator has to be chosen.
The moderator has to be respectful, objective, and he must follow the list of agenda items.

The role of the moderator is to give the floor to the people who want to express themselves on the current subject and to organize the debate.
To do this, we could imagine a kind of protocol similar to this:

1. The moderator states the current subject and the previous suggestions for this subject that have been rejected by the members of Akyanet.
2. People who want to express themselves on the subject can use a predefined signal like raising their hand.
3. The moderator gives the floor to a random person wanting to express himself on the subject using a random number generator or his sense of random (not recommended).
4. The selected person expresses himself on the subject.
5. Once the selected person has finished talking, the moderator takes the floor.
6. The moderator asks if somebody has a comment on what the previous person said.
7. As for the second step, people who want to express themselves use a predefined signal.
8. Same as the third step.
9. Same as the fourth step.
10. Repeat from the sixth step until nobody wants to comment on the subject anymore.
11. The moderator takes the floor and ask if everyone has finished talking.
12. If yes, then go to the next step. Otherwise, go to the seventh step.
13. The moderator announces that it is time to come with suggestions.
14. The moderator gives the time for everyone to create and write a suggestion. If suggestions have not been pre-written and it takes too much time for everyone to agree with a suggestion or to write one, the next step can be executed later (e.g. in the next days). (This is usually how it will happen.)
15. Once everyone agrees with a suggestion or has written a suggestion, the moderator lets everyone state their position (if they agree with a suggestion or on some points of a suggestions, their objections, or their own suggestion).
16. Once everyone has stated their position, the moderator asks if someone has something to say about the suggestions.
17. If yes, start again from step one with the subjects being the given suggestions. Otherwise, the suggestions will be compiled in one document for each representative so that they speak with the people they represent to organize a vote about the suggestions.
18. If the outcome of this vote is that they refuse all the suggestions, go to the next step, etc. Otherwise, if a suggestion has been chosen, it will be applied and the representative can work on other subject.
19. In this case, the representatives will have to discuss with the people to know their point of view, their suggestions, their objections, etc. So that he can build new suggestions and better represent their interests in the debates.

Obviously, the moderator is revokable.

Interrupting someone who has the floor without a good reason (e.g. because the one who has the floor is having a violent or harmful speech) results in a public mention in official records about this fact and an intervention of a social worker after the session to help him understand why he should not interrupt others.
If it is the third time he is interrupting someone without a good reason, he will be revoked and he will have to talk about this to social workers.

[This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making) can be useful to understand more about consensus decision-making.

### Discrimination and tolerance

Discrimination and intolerance should be avoided at all costs, or even prohibited.

Intolerant people should not be punished, only their intolerant ideas should.
Such people should or must discuss with social workers to make them understand why intolerance is bad for everyone.

By discrimination, I mean restricting people from accessing something depending on their gender, race, etc.
"Discrimination" for accessing jobs in risky work fields is allowed if justifiable.
This kind of discrimination must be based only on their knowledge concerning their new work field.
See the "[Education](#education)" section.

Discrimination and intolerance should not be tolerated, even if it seems paradoxal.

### Secrets for defence

Information threatening the safety of Akyanet members and other people should not be disclosed until the threat induced by the information disappears.

Since we must not hide information from the people, this kind of information should be acknowledged but not disclosed until the threat is gone.
We could do this by writing, for example, "This information could threaten the safety of some people if disclosed. It will be disclosed as soon as the threat disappears."

### Privacy

Online privacy should be a really important concept that must be integrated within Akyanet.

Privacy options should be turned on by default.

The Akyanet website must respect the [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) anywhere in the world.

## Notes

### From PhirosWolf

First, in this document, if you read "I" without specification about who is "I", it means it is me, PhirosWolf.

Then, I would like to say that I'm not a professional in the anarcho-communist theory, and I know this document lacks the application of some principles, but I just don't know how to apply them.
But all I want to do is helping making the world a better place.
This is why this document is open-source and everyone can contribute to Akyanet.

For example, in the chapter on politics, the representative system can be problematic, and the idea of the Global Coordinator is maybe wrong, but I don't know, for now, how to fix or improve it.
So if you have any suggestions or any ideas about how we could create a better system, you can create a pull request, you can direct-message me, you can create an issue on the repository, or you can create a fork of this repository.

When I write "competition", I mean the competition like competition between markets and companies, not competition of biological evolution or sportive competition.

In this document, when "he", "his", and "him" is written, it is just a way of simplifying the document readability.
It does not mean that we are excluding people.

Anyway, I hope this whole document and the future Akyanet website will help making things move.

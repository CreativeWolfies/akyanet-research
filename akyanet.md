## Introduction

The purpose of Akyanet is to be a better society and an accessible one.
This will never be a perfect society because it does not exist.
But we can try to go as close as possible to this utopia.

-----

## Our world and our society

### What's wrong?

Actually, a lot.
The ubiquity of the money for example.
Money gives power.
And this power is concentrated in hands of a few people.
It creates gaps between people and makes us go straight into the wall.
Corruption exists mainly because of money.

Money is not the only problem.
There is also weapons of mass destruction, war, unfair justice, lack of equality, etc.
We live in a world where the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles to be part of the so-called "bourgeoisie" in the hope of feeling better.
There is something wrong about this system.
We dream of becoming someone rich to get the things we like.
And to do this, our current society suggests that we must compete against others and forget the ones at the bottom because they "deserved it".

### I'm fine with this system, so why change it?

Because you are not alone in this world.
Entire countries suffer from this system because they are enslaved by richer countries like Western Europe, China, and United States of America.
They are not the only ones, but the main ones to abuse from other countries.
By this I do not mean that the population of Western Europe, China, and United States of America are bad people, I just want to say that their governments and big corporations are responsible for this abuse.

The population of these wealthy countries are the mere reflection of the consumerist world we're living in today.
Some of these people live in ignorance, some are just fully indoctrinated by their society’s propaganda, and some live in the uncomfortable position of knowing what their government and big corporations perpetrate and feeling powerless to these acts.

The reason of this change becomes clear when you focus on every details of our world instead of simply following orders to look at the poor countries as "barbarian countries" and "useless countries" because they "deserved it".

### What changes do we have to do?

My answer to this question is this document.
I am open to suggestions to improve my answer and I do not pretend that my answer, and therefore, my document, is perfect.

## Akyanet

### Purpose

The purpose of Akyanet is to offer a solution to many problems we are facing in our current society by offering alternatives to money, justice, democracy, etc.
The goal is to make everyone equal.
In this case, "equal" does not mean having the same thoughts, the same opinions, clothes, etc.
But rather equal access to justice, equal access to vote, equal access to resources, equal access to education and so on.

### Akyanet development

The first step is to create a basic and online version of Akyanet so that we can improve the foundations of Akyanet.
The next step is to implement all the "features" of Akyanet in this online version and gather more people to improve Akyanet again.

Once this is done, the third step is the physical propagation.
By physical propagation I mean that some members of Akyanet will start to rely partly or fully on Akyanet to show that it is possible to live with a more social and equal society.

The next step is to have whole regions living with Akynet and to promote Akyanet to other people and never, never harm people in any way.
The final step is when large regions will live everyday with Akyanet and, most importantly, be happy with it.

None of these steps must cause indirect and/or direct harm to anyone.

### Concepts

#### Service points

Service points are the basis of every exchange in Akyanet.
A point should take into account the geographic context of the producer, the producer situation, the service quality, the time of production, and much more.
But, for instance, service quality is pretty difficult to quantify, so, Akyanet uses another system, which is also based on points.

A point represents one and only one service.
So you can own multiple points depending on your work.
The value of a point is only indicative. The real value comes with the exchange table.

##### Public service points

Public service points are service points given by the administration when achieving a job from the primary sector (agriculture, etc.) or by achieving a public task.
These points can be exchanged with every other service points.
But no service points could be converted into public service points.

##### Service points conversion

Before converting a point to another one, we must have a "route" between these two points.
A route has a orientation and a conversion ratio.
To understand routes more easily, let us define two services: A and B.
A and B have no routes between them.
To create one or two routes between A and B, the owner of service A must agree to a conversion ratio with the owner of service B.
Then, a route from A to B or from B to A (or both. It depends on the agreement made between the owner of service A and the owner of service B) can be created.

You can delete a route that goes from one of your service to a service owned by a different person without condition.
Once you delete this route, the owner of the other service will be notified.
If this person (the owner of the other service) does not want this route to be deleted, he can contest the deletion by reporting it to the justice administration within 30 days starting from the reception of the report or from the certified timestamp of the report if present.

Once we have a route, we simply apply the conversation ratio of the given route to the number of points we want to convert.

##### Public service points conversion

Conversion of public service points is pretty different from the conversion for "normal" service points.
First, public service points can be converted into any other service points.
The conversation ratio of routes from public service points to other service points are decided by the owner of the other service point and partly by the administration.
The conversion ratio of these special routes can be modified if the administration agrees on another ratio with the owner of the other service.

There are no routes leading to public service points.

##### Points exchange

This is where indicative values become real products.
To exchange points for real things, we need an exchange table.
An exchange table will list all available services, how many points you need for it, if the order is scalable and the condition of the service (e.g. delay).

##### Points giveaways

If you have "leftover" points, you can give them away using two different methods. The first one is the random giveaway method. You choose the points you want to give, and then they will be given to an random and active members of Akyanet. The other method consists of splitting these points to give a part to every active members of Akyanet.

For these two methods, you can choose between the whole population of Akyanet, a given region, a random region, a given part of a region, a random part of a region, or a random part of a random region.

#### Scores and badges

Scores and badges are ways to prevent fraudulent, illegal, immoral, or unethical services before the intervention of Justice.
They also are ways to promote innovative services and help people new to Akyanet.

##### Scores

Each member has multiple scores. Here are some of them:

- Supply score: The number of fulfilled services for accepted service requests divided by accepted service requests.
- Community score: Average score given by the community for one service.
- Service score: Average of supply score, community score, and every other scores related to one service.

No scores related to the person instead of his services must exist because they can create discrimination and unwanted competition/concurrency.

##### Badges

As mentioned previously, badges can promote new members, innovative services, and also prevent “unwanted” services.

Badges can be issued by the badges administration and certified automated systems controlled by the badges administration.
They can also be indirectly issued by the community.

There are two types of badges: member badges and service badges.
Member badges are badges attributed to an Akyanet member.
Service badges are attributed to a specific service.

Some examples of badges are given below.

- Innovation badge (member badge, service badge).
- Administration member badge (member badge).
- Quality badge (member badge, service badge).
- Akyanet support badge; obtained when helping (financially or by other ways) the Akyanet project (member badge).
- Approved member badge; obtained and preserved after a successful monthy/bimonthly review of the member who requests this badge to the badges administration.

New badges can only be created by the badges administration.
Every member of Akyanet can submit badge ideas to the badges administration.

## Drafts (W.I.P.)

### Inheritance and will

|  | **Without will** | **With will** |
|-:|:----------------:|:-------------:|
| **You have no companion** | All of your goods are shared equally among the whole Akyanet community | You can dispose all of your goods in the way you want.  |
| **You have one or more companions** | A quarter of your goods is shared equally among the whole Akyanet community and the rest is shared equally among your conjoints | You can dispose all of your goods in the way you want. |

You can clearly see that writing your will is better for you because it allows you to choose what goods will go to whom.

There are multiple will forms:

1. Certified form
2. Holographic form
3. Free form

#### Certified will

A will is defined as a certified will when it meets all these conditions:

- The testator is approved by Akyanet for writing other people's will.
- The testator is not the will's owner (the person who dies having created a will before death).
- The will is written in a computer file.
- The will is registered in an official last will database.
- The will is electronically signed by the testator, the will's owner, and the witnesses.
- The will contains the scanned image of the signature of the testator, the will's owner, and the witnesses. Each signature must be clearly linked to their owner.
- All references to people or entities (regions, associations, etc.) must be valid.
- It contains the date of the document writing's end.
- ...

[WIP]

### Army

Joining the army is optional. No one must be forced to join the army.

You can leave the army whenever you want.

The goals of the Akyanet army are:

- Promoting peace inside and outside Akyanet.
- Banning mass destruction weapons everywhere.
- Banning weapons everywhere.
- Helping regions to join Akyanet if they are willing to.
- Helping non-Akyanet regions' population in case of dramatic events (for example, global health issues).
- Helping for the maintenance of public facilities as well as for public tasks.

TODO: Talk about whether or not army and police can have weapons. Talk about the right to kill.

### Selling products to non-Akyanet entities

You have the right to sell your products to non-Akyanet entites but this not advised.

Nevertheless, if you sell a product to a non-Akyanet entity, you can give a part of the earnings to Akyanet and choose for what it should be used.

## Ideas

Giveaways (if you have “leftover” points, you can give them to this system. You can choose between giving all the points to a random person or to everyone. The more you give away, the more likely you are to get a “special donation”)

Special donations (you can ask for a donation when you really want something. This donation is fully funded by other members. A weighted random algorithm is used on the registered members wanting a donation. The frequency of this draw is not defined yet. Maybe this system will not be used at all)

Public wish list (a place where everyone can share, anonymously, what they wish. If someone desires to give something that someone is wishing, they can resolve this wish. They can also give with conditions (like “you have to do this if I give it to you”))

Fast public wish list (same as the public list, but the only human action needed is when an offer is made for your wish)
No item acquired for a price P must be sold for a higher price.

Must define the stack-algorithm for the routes

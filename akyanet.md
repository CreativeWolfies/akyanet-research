## Introduction

The purpose of Akyanet is to be a better society and an accessible one.
This will never be a perfect society because it does not exist.
But we can try to go as close as possible to this utopia.

-----

## Our world and our society

### What's wrong?

Actually, a lot.
The ubiquity of the money for example.
Money gives power.
And this power is concentrated in hands of a few people.
It creates gaps between people and makes us go straight into the wall.
Corruption exists mainly because of money.

Money is not the only problem.
There is also weapons of mass destruction, war, unfair justice, lack of equality, etc.
We live in a world where the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles to be part of the so-called "bourgeoisie" in the hope of feeling better.
There is something wrong about this system.
We dream of becoming rich to get the things we like.
And to do this, our current society suggests that we must compete against others and forget the ones at the bottom because they "deserved it".

### I'm fine with this system, so why change it?

Because you are not alone in this world.
Entire countries suffer from this system because they are enslaved by richer countries like Western Europe, China, and United States of America.
They are not the only ones, but the main ones to abuse from other countries.
By this I do not mean that the population of Western Europe, China, and United States of America are bad people, I just want to say that their governments and big corporations are responsible for this abuse.

The population of these wealthy countries are the mere reflection of the consumerist world we're living in today.
Some of these people live in ignorance, some are just fully indoctrinated by their societyâ€™s propaganda, and some live in the uncomfortable position of knowing what their government and big corporations perpetrate and feeling powerless to these acts.

The reason of this change becomes clear when you focus on every details of our world instead of simply following orders to look at the poor countries as "barbarian countries" and "useless countries" because they "deserved it".

## What is Akyanet?

Akyanet is a new society based on the anarcho-communist ideology.
Many fear the words "communism" and "anarchism" because of their current connotation.
Let us take the first word, "communism". According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism):
> Communism is a philosophical, social, political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic orderstructured upon **the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.**

This is pretty different from the totalitarian dictatorship many people think.
This misnamed definition perhaps originates from [McCarthyism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism) or the global fear of communism caused by the USSR and the cold war.
Basically, this propaganda from the past is having a long-lasting effect on the word "communism".

Unfortunately, this is not the only word suffering from misnaming. Let us take the case of "anarchism".
As for the previous word, here is the definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism):
> Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is **sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy**.
> Anarchism calls for the **abolition of the state, which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful**.
> It is usually described alongside libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing (libertarian socialism) of the socialist movement and as having a historical association with anti-capitalism and socialism.

And the popular definition could be expressed simply by "the abolition of all rules, chaos; Confusion and disorder". But this is a confusion with [anomie](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anomie). Wiktionary:
> Alienation or social instability caused by erosion of standards and values.

Now that you have the correct definitions, we can define what is the purpose of Akyanet.

## The goals of Akyanet

Akyanet has many goals and they will evolve over time, we are going to list a few foundamental ones.

"Better" should no longer mean "more profitable", it should just stick to its original definition. i.e. "To surpass in excellence; to exceed; to excel.".
In Akyanet, it could also mean improving the social welfare.

Everyone should be equal.
This means nobody should be oppressed, discriminated, or prevented from taking part in the development of Akyanet.

Hierarchies must be prohibited **except** when they are vital.
For example, on a ship, there must be a captain to give orders as for piloting the ship correctly.
But the captain must be aware that he is not in a position of power.
This means that the captain could also do some chores on the ship if it does not compromise the safety of the people on board.

We must seek to achieve total autonomy within Akyanet.
Which means that the community is able to give appropriate housing for everyone, food, electricity, running water, heating, internet, health services, etc. without external help.
But it does not mean that we should isolate from people that are not part of Akyanet.

Money should be abolished because it will become obsolete (we will talk about that in next chapters).

Art should remain art. In our current capitalist society, art is worthless except if you can sell it.
And to sell it, it must become a product and not art.
Imagine being a talented painter that can paint magnificent landscapes but with your own style and also know how to paint with a style similar to Picasso, but you do not like painting this way.
Well, within the capitalist society, since your own style does not matter, you will be forced to make Picasso-like paintings because you cannot live off your own style.

Ecology must be a priority. Unsustainable energy must be prohibited except for research purposes.

## How Akyanet works

In this chapter, we will talk about how Akyanet is organized. But keep in mind that it could evolve over time if the members democratically decide to change the organisation.

### Districts, communes, and union of communes

Let us begin by districts.
A district is a group of 150 people maximum to prevent social isolation.
Exceptions can be made when, for example, you have a 152 people living near each other but are far from other groups of people.

A commune is a union of districts.
Preferably geographicaly close to each other.
Communes are limited to 10000 people but as for the districts, there can be exceptions, and this limit can change over time.

Unions of communes are... unions of communes, obviously.
As for the communes, it is preferable that they are geographicaly near one another.
Unions of communes are not limited in population.

### Joining a district, Leaving a district, and the social contract

You can join a district whenever you want.
There are no prerequisites for joining a district.

When you want to join a district, you will need to establish a contract with people responsible for this task (which are chosen democratically by the district members, so it could be the district council, an individual, or the whole district. It is entirely up to the district).
This contract, called the social contract, will describe what the district guarantees to you (housing, food, etc.) and what you guarantee to give to the district (performing essential tasks, etc.).

The social contract must respect the rules defined by the Global Coordinator (more on that later).
Additional terms of the contract are to be defined when establishing the contract.

You have the right to leave your district, your commune, and your union of communes whenever you want.

### Essential tasks

In every commune or district, depending on their geographical situation, random members or all members depending on the number of tasks will be asked to perform certain tasks (for example, cleaning the streets, taking out the trash, ...) according to their social contract.

Members can ask to have another task attributed to them but they must understand that every task is essential and if they slightly dislike their attributed task, it is not really a good reason to ask for another attribution.
But coercive forces must be avoided, so the commune or the district will have to make sure that everyone knows why they are doing these tasks and how they are essential.

If two members agree on exchanging their tasks, it is up to the district/commune council to decide if they can do it without prior authorization from the district/commune council.
This authorization is sometimes needed to be sure that the members know how to perform their task.
But as always, coercive forces must be avoided at all costs.

It is up to the district to choose how and when the tasks will be attributed.

Given tasks should be adapted to each individual according to their work and their capabilities.
For example, students will be given tasks relative to the subjects they are studying so that they can improve their education while helping the community by doing essential tasks.

If a district does not have enough people to perform all essential tasks, the district can ask for help from the commune.

### Politics

Each district have a district council which is in charge of representing the district at the communal level.
The representatives are elected by the district using [Schulze STV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_STV) and they have a 3 month mandate.
Representatives can be revoked at any time if the majority (50% + 1) of the district members vote to.

The role of a representative is to represent the interests of a district and to explain to its district what the subjects were at the commune, what they will vote in the next weeks, etc.
The representatives cannot vote on behalf of the district, instead, all the commune members will vote.
Any subject (change in communal rules, tasks organisation, ...) is passed only if the majority (50% + 1) of the commune members vote for.

Unions of communes works in the same way.
But instead of electing representatives in each district, representatives will be elected in each commune by the commune members using [Schulze STV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_STV).

This means that districts cannot choose representatives if they have a population of less than 3 people.
In this case, all the district population are their own representatives.

Everyone can spectate the communal council meetings and the meetings of the union of communes.

Regularly organising meetings with the district and its representatives is strongly advised.

*PhirosWolf's note*:
> I think this section will be rewritten often because of its complexity (votings, representatives, ...).

### Justice

If a member violates the district rules, the communal rules, the rules of the union of communes, or the rules of the Global Coordinator, he will be assigned to a psychological or medical intervention depending on the rule that has been violated.

If you see a member violating a rule, you can report it to the social workers of the commune or to one of the assigned associations for this task.

If you have a problem with another member but it is not governed by the local rules, you can either talk about your problem to members of your district and/or to the local social workers to solve your problem quickly by finding common ground, but if this does not work, you can submit your case to one of the assigned associations for this task.

In cases of recidivism, violent actions, etc., emergency response teams can be dispatched to prevent the problematic member to harm other members.
Then, the district or commune (if the district refuses to take the case) where the member is living can decide the fate of his social contract and if he need a psychological or medical intervention, if he need to understand more about something (social workers will take care of this), or, in extreme cases, if he need to be kicked from his district/commune/union of commune or even Akyanet.
But you must remember that coercive forces must be avoided.

### Global Coordinator

The Global Coordinator, or GC, is a group of representatives, emergency response teams' representatives, professionals, experts, and individuals.
They are all revokable.

Everyone can join the Global Coordinator, but they must be aware that their work will be public (open-source).

The purpose of the Global Coordinator is to solve major problems.

The to do list is a priority queue that can be found online.
This means everyone can submit a task to the list, but they must have a certain number of upvotes to have a greater priority.

Tasks with less than 100 upvotes within 100 days from the day of the day of the task's submission will be removed from the queue.
They can also be removed if the task have more than 100 downvotes within 50 days from the day of the task's submission.

These numbers will evolve depending of the number of members in Akyanet.

If the same task is added to the queue within 50 days from the removal of the task, it will be instantly removed from the queue.

When submitting a task, it has, by default, 0 upvotes.
As a reminder, one upvote plus one downvote = 0.

The Global Coordinator also defines the rules that everyone must respect.
To add, remove, or change one of these rules, you will need to submit a task about this in the Global Coordinator to do list (priority queue), then, the Global Coordinator will organise a vote where the entire community of Akyanet will participate.
The subject of the vote is passed if the majority (50% + 1) of the community voted for.

### Voting

Voting is pretty difficult to implement.
This is why this version of this document is not precise about every case (for exemple, in case of major health issues (pandemics, ...)) and how they should be handled.

*PhirosWolf's note*:
> I'm not an expert on every subject, so if you have an idea of how this document could be more precise and/or cover more subjects, you could always help me to complete this document.

When talking about majority in voting and writing `(50% + 1)` next to it, it means 50% of the concerned community plus one vote is necessary to define it as the majority.

### Associations

In Akyanet, the freedom of association is fully guaranteed.
To put simply, the freedom of association is the right to associate (form groups) with other people.
Here is the definition of the [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/freedom_of_association):
> The right of citizens to come together with other individuals and collectively express, promote, pursue and defend common interests.

Associations can be pretty useful in Akyanet because they can bring together people with the same interests such as, for example, programming, drawing, and much more.

Everyone can create an association at any time.

An association is dissolved when it has zero members left.

An association can be a group of people sharing one or multiple common goals, but it could also be similar to a community, where new members can talk with more experienced members relative to the community's topic.

You can join and leave an association as you like.
You can even join multiple associations.

As for districts, you are free to leave an association whenever you want.

### Work

In Akyanet, the 20 hours week will be established (4h per day for 5 days).
You are free to organise your work days, like, instead of 4 hours per day for 5 days, you could do 8h per day for 2 days followed by 4 hours of work the next day.

In some cases, the work week can be longer.
For instance, emergency response teams will have longer work weeks.
But, in compensation, they can be exempted from essential tasks if they want to.

"Work" consist of doing essential tasks and/or tasks related to your profession.
Education is also considered as work.

For instance, you might be a mason and you are part of the association for masonry.
In this case, your work will perhaps be to build the foundations of a new home or to discuss with the association about how the homes could be improved.

In case you are not part of an association, you could either join one, work for communes or individuals, or work for yourself and then give the product of your work to the community.

The production must match the demand of the given product.
If the production is greater than the demand, we have to make sure that it does not impact ecology directly (e.g. CO2 emissions) or indirectly (e.g. higher power consumption may emit more CO2 because of the power plant's CO2 emissions) or impact social relationships etc.
Therefore, if the impact is non-existent or positive (positive as in "positive for the ecology" not "an impact greater than zero"), then overproduction is authorized but not necessarily advised (in case of non-existent impact).
This means that, before overproducing, the concerned associations and workers must really think about if it is really necessary.

In case the production is not sufficient to cover demand, we have multiple solutions:
- Lower the demand by finding an alternative product.
- Increase the production by asking district, communes, or unions of communes to help in creating more means of production, improving the production process, or finding workers interested in working full time or part time in this field of production (without using coercive forces, as always).
- Using external sources to compensate the difference between production and demand. (This solution should be avoided to improve autonomy.)

The work week could be shortened if the production is sufficient.

If you are between 14 and 18 years old, you have the right to work and do essential tasks but only on a voluntary basis.
Forcing someone under 18 years old is strictly prohibited because it is considered as child labour.
The only exception is education.

The rest of the week is dedicated to leisure, we will talk about that later.

### Agreements

An agreement could be thought as a contract, but without the state policing behind it.

In an agreement, you state the parties of the contract, the current date, and what each parties want from the other parties.
Then, the parties to the agreement can sign it and distribute a copy to each parties for extra verifiability.
This could also be done by creating the agreement online (on the Akyanet website).

Agreements should not be the main to exchange services.
They are just tools for long-term services or just to keep track of what services you have to do.

Members of Akyanet must understand that trust is fundamental.

Changing or revoking an agreement after concluding it is possible if all the involved parties consent to it.

If a member is found to abuse the trust of others, social workers or workers in the domain of psychology and/or medicine will take his case.
In extreme forms of abuse, the justice system will take his case.

### Gifts

If you have a product which is not useful for you anymore or because you produced it with a view to offering it as a gift, you can give it to an individual, an association, and any other entities within Akyanet (districts, communes, ...).

The website of Akyanet will also provide a way of gifting via an online and/or real-life [give-away shop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give-away_shop).
This online give-away shop will have some rules to prevent people from acquiring all at the same time.

Here are some ideas for these rules:
- Random selection for products with insufficient quantities.
- Queued limited wish lists (the one which waited the most for a product gets it first. The wish list has a limited number of products you can wait for).
- "First come, first served".

Maybe there can be multiple online or real-life give-away shops.

### Leisure

With the 20 hours work week, leisure will take a bigger place in life.
If your passion is art, then you will be able to experiment with your style of art, discuss and cooperate with members of associations for art.
Leisure is vital for individual development so that you can understand more about yourself, your environment, and how you could contribute to the society.

Unfortunately, the capitalist society is a place where leisure is considered as useless or a mean of exploitation.
When considered as useless, your work time will overflow on your only free time, the week-end.
When considered as a mean of exploitation, you will be employed for your passion so that they can profit from your voluntary, forced, or secretly forced ([Crunch culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer#Crunch_time)) overtime.

As Pyotr Kropotkin said,
> After bread has been secured, leisure is the supreme aim.

### Holidays

Since a lot of holidays are related to religious events, they indirectly indoctrinate children because the children parents will probably have to remind, every time these holidays occur, the origin of this holiday.

This is why these holidays will be abolished and replaced by new holidays.

These new holidays will be related to historical event including, but not limited to, general strikes, important anarcho-communist events, days where significant progress in science has been made, etc.

Holidays will become fully indicative.
This means that you will not be automatically exempted from your work and your essential tasks.
Some holidays will still require essential tasks to be done, while others will not.

If you want to take off days for these holidays or for other occasions, you are free to do so.
But you must remember that working is vital for the community.

If you are part of one or multiple associations, you will, maybe, have to find a common ground with your coworkers to organize your work and when you will take off days.

### Emergency Response Teams (ERTs)

Emergency response teams are groups of people in charge of emergencies (fires, violence, health emergencies).
Their role is to guarantee the security of the community and its well-being.

Since they have such an important role, they can ask for essential tasks exemption so that they can react quickly in case of an emergency.

This kind of teams can only be organized by a commune or an union of commmunes.

These teams are fully autonomous.
But in the case of militias, the use of their firearms should be closely monitored.

The composition of these teams are based on voluntary service.

ERTs equipment is given by Akyanet (the organizer entity if they have enough equipment, or other Akyanet entities (districts, communes, unions of communes, associations)).

These teams are not limited to the borders of its organizer entity.
They could even help people outside Akyanet.

Since ERTs are autonomous, they can choose how they organize themselves, for instance, by creating a pseudo-hierarchy (choosing democratically the one to give orders etc.).

As for hierarchies, this pseudo-hierarchy must be justifiable.

#### Fire

The role of the emergency response teams for fire, or ERTsF in short, is to prevent uncontrollable fires and to estinguish them.

As for militias, there is multiple types of ERTsF, but each ERTF is in charge of organizing these groups.

#### Militias

The role of the militias is to protect people from violent people.

We can distinguish multiple types of militias:

Name | Are in charge of... | Have access to...
-----|---------------------|------------------
Border militias | Protecting Akyanet borders if and only if the contry sharing the border is threatening military intervention or any other violent and/or armed conflict/intervention | Heavy protection, heavy weapons, fire arms, non-lethal weapons
Emergency response teams for extreme violence (ERTsEV) | Protecting people from an extremely violent group or from extremely violent individuals | Heavy protection, fire arms and non-lethal weapons
Emergency response teams for violence (ERTsV) | Protecting people from violent groups and violent individuals | Classical protection, non-lethal weapons and, in some cases, fire arms and heavy protection

Every militia that have access to lethal weapons must be closely monitored so that they do not use these weapons against themselves or against non-threatening people.
If a milita uses their lethal weapons against non-threatening people, ERTsEV or members of border militias will be sent to retrive the lethal weapons.

Border militias and ERTsEV have the right to kill.
**This right must only be used if any other non-lethal solution cannot be used at all**.

All militias must respect all Geneva Conventions and all of its additional protocols.
And since militias are autonomous, they could agree on additional rules.

**Peace is precious**, so border militias must not shoot first, not provoke, etc.
Peace measures must be strictly applied.
All militias are in charge of promoting peace, not war.

*PhirosWolf's note*:
> I strongly insist on this point: peace is precious.
> So DO NOT spoil it stupidly.
> I don't want Akyanet to have blood on its hands.

#### Health

The role of the emergency response teams for health (ERTsH) is to help people who are in life-threatening health emergencies or to help people who need medical care quickly.

As for militias, there is multiple types of ERTsH (nurses, paramedics, ...), but each ERTH is in charge of organizing these groups.

#### Civil protection

The role of the emergency response teams for civil protection (ERTsCP) is to help people in case of a disaster.
This help can take many forms such as helping them to move to shelter.

As for militias, there is multiple types of ERTsCP, but each ERTCP is in charge of organizing these groups.

### Postal services

Postal services in Akyanet will be guaranteed by voluntaries.

We could imagine a system with an online register that could create the path of the parcels/letters.
Every voluntary which are part of the given route will give the parcels and/or letters to the next node of the route by his own means.

### Education

In Akyanet, education is free and studying is considered as work.

We can distinguish two phases of education: Compulsory education (from 5/6 years old to 15/16 years old) and higher education.

It is strongly advised that children from 5/6 years old to 15/16 years old go to school so that they can have a basic knowledge in multiple domains.

If one child needs home schooling (because he asked to or the social workers noticed it), then the parents will be asked if they can and want to teach their child or if they need someone that can do this work.

In case the parents teach to their child, the parents will received lessons about how to teach to children.

Another alternative for home schooling is online teaching.

In our current society, compulsory education aims at teaching basic knowledge the same way for everyone.
This is wrong (see [this video](https://youtu.be/dqTTojTija8) to better understand why).

Education should teach basic knowledge to everyone but the teaching method can be different from one person to another.

We should stop making overcrowded classes.

If a child or an adult has facilities with his education, he can get along with his teachers to ask them if he can skip a grade.

Exams should be removed except in one case: if the courses you take are related to a risky work field (doctor of medicine, train conductor, nuclear power plant operator, etc.) or a work field needing long education (doctors, etc.).
In this case, an exam can be organized at the end of each year, at the end of your courses, or before major events (e.g. Passing an exam to know if you are able to operate research nuclear reactors).
Certificates can be given to students after their final exam.

Entrance exams and prerequisite certificates limitations are tolerated if they are justifiable.

Schools should stop putting limitations (like minimum age) on entrance exams.

Schools do not necessarily need to be ran by professional teachers.
These kinds of teachers is a great way to expend the fields covered by education.
This means domains considered as hobbies in our current society (e.g. cosplaying) could be covered by a real and free education and will finally be recognized as a real work.
Basically, the same features as [folk high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_high_school#Features).

*PhirosWolf's note*:
> The system I aim is an education where everyone could learn what he wants and with meaningful explanations and exercises.

### Public transports

Public transports are organized by associations.

Most of the conductors/pilots will have to be certificated in order to reduce the risk of accidents.

Public transports are really important if we want to progress towards zero carbon footprint.

### Public facilities

Public facilities are places dedicated to accomplish a given task.

For example, general use halls, public workbenches (tools exchange), etc. are public facilities.

Some of them, like the general use halls, can be reserved by individuals or by groups for certain dates.

### Medias

[Freedom of the press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press), [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech), and [freedom of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information) will be guaranteed.

[Fact-checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking) is important.
All medias will be strongly advised to add a kind of fact-checking score on each article / each news so that people can quickly see the veracity of the article/news to prevent [media manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_manipulation).
This fact-checking score can be determined by computing the average of the scores given by fact-checking associations.

To create a media, you just need to create an association for it.

### Housing

Appropriate housing should be given to everyone.

The best would be to have common rooms (kitchen, toilets, living room) and 1 personal room per person.

"But what about the luxury houses?" you might ask.
Well, for now, housing will depend on the houses inside your district.
But I am aware that this is not a good solution, so we should find a fairer solution.

Maintenance of the houses and apartments are done by their occupants or by specialized people in cases of serious damages/problems.

### Joining and leaving Akyanet

Depending on the phase Akyanet is currently in, you can join Akyanet by various means.

One of the easiest is via the Akyanet website.
Later, Akyanet you will be able to join Akyanet by mail.

When joining, you will need to fill a registration form for the creation of your Akyanet ID Card and for your online Akyanet account.

If you want to leave Akyanet, you can do so by the same means available for joining (online or, later, by mail).
By doing so, your Akyanet ID Card will be revoked and your online Akyanet account will be deleted.
Before leaving, you might want to organize with the associations you joined and with the people you concluded agreements with.

To prevent abuse when creating agreements, they are advised to check the seniority of the parties they are concluding the agreement with.

### Akyanet ID Card

The Akyanet ID Card is a card containing information about yourself to "prove" to people outside Akyanet that you are a member of Akyanet.

Here is a list of the pieces of information the Akyanet ID Card might contain:
- Name (The one you choose to have in Akyanet, not necessarily your real name)
- Date of birth
- Registration date
- [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
- Profile picture (optional)
- Signature

The name, profile picture, and signature can be changed at any time.

## About

### Family

Parents need to understand that their children are not their property even though they are responsible for their actions until they are considered as adults (18 years old).
This means that parents need to cooperate with their children, not limiting their children with their (parents) sets of ideas.

I can understand that parents seek to protect their children against bad influence, but by doing so, some of them end up protecting them against good things without knowing it or without acknowledging it.

I am not saying that parents should let their children do anything they want, I am just saying that they should find the right balance between protection and laissez-faire.

If children have problems with their parents or the other way around, social workers are here to help.

### Religion

Freedom of religion is guaranteed within Akyanet, but I think that religion has a bad influence over people by instilling them a fixed way to think and/or to analyze situations.

A majority of religions are, by their holy books, against the most foundamental anarcho-communist ideas, such as liberty and equality.

As an example, in the Bible, we can read this:
> [...] Because **the Israelites are my servants** (1), whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.
> Do not rule over them ruthlessly, but **fear your God** (2).
> **Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves** (3).
> **You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property** (4).
> **You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life** (5), but **you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly** (6).
> If a foreigner residing among you becomes rich and any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to the foreigner or to a member of the foreignerâ€™s clan, they retain the right of redemption after they have sold themselves. [...]

1. Hierarchy.
2. Hierarchy and fear of the upper class.
3. Slavery.
4. Slavery.
5. Slavery.
6. Discrimination, therefore, infringing equality.

This quote is said by God himself at Leviticus 25:42-48 and the phrasing is from the New International Version of the Bible found on [biblestudytools.com](https://www.biblestudytools.com/).
This is just an example.
Other holy books and scriptures contain similar infringements of liberty and equality.

Theists and deists should not let their faith influence their decision-making process to prevent [magical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking) and to promote [rational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality).
I know that it will be difficult for them to against their faith in some cases, and for some of them, it will be impossible.
But it is vital for them to understand why rationality is more important than their religion.

In Akyanet territory, parishes, churches, cathedrals, and all other religious buildings will become public facilities.
Theists and deists can still use these places if they find common ground with other people wanting to use these places.

In Akyanet, religious indoctrination should be avoided.

### Borders

Borders within Akyanet are defined by Akyanet entities (districts, communes, unions of communes).
These borders are **only** for administrative purposes, not for creating rivalities between members of Akyanet entities.

[Freedom of movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement) is guaranteed between inside borders.

Borders between Akyanet and other nations should, as far as possible, remain open.

In the case of dangerous borders (where the neighboring nation is threatening Akyanet), people can still cross the border if they come without the intent of doing harm to other people.
In some cases, dangerous borders can be closed if closing the border is the best solution for everyone even if it is not recommended.

One of the disadvantages of having open borders is that spies can come and go as they like in Akyanet.
If the only goal of these spies is to gather information about Akyanet, they will be disappointed since the freedom of information is guaranteed, therefore, all pieces of information about Akyanet actions are open.
But spies' goals are not limited to gathering information.
If they come from a threatening nation, maybe their goals will be to cause panic and confusion, or infiltrate militias to provoke immoral actions in the name of Akyanet to let their home nation to declare war to Akyanet.

This problem must be fixed by Akyanet when this will become a real problem.

### Advertising

Advertising will not exist since everyone is able to get products from associations at their right value.

Advertising comes with competition, the opposite of cooperation, therefore, the opposite of Akyanet.

### Akyanet development

Akyanet will evolve with its population.

We can divide the development of Akyanet in multiple phases:

1. Akyanet will have few members and most of the members' needs cannot be fulfilled by Akyanet. Joining Akyanet will require the approval of the founders or people assigned to this task.
2. Akyanet will still have few members, but more than before. Some of the members' needs can be fulfilled by Akyanet. Joining Akyanet will still require the approval of the founders or people assigned to this task, but the entry criteria will accept more people into Akyanet.
3. Akyanet will begin to have districts, thus more members. More of the members' needs can be fulfilled by Akyanet. The entry criteria will accept even more people in.
4. Akyanet will begin to have communes, thus more members. More of the members' needs can be fulfilled by Akyanet. The entry criteria will accept almost all people in.
5. Akyanet will begin to have more communes, maybe unions of communes. Essential needs can be fulfilled by Akyanet. The entry criteria will accept almost all people in.
6. Akyanet can fulfill basic needs for everyone. The entry criteria will be removed.
7. Akyanet can fulfill more needs for everyone.
8. Akyanet can fulfill almost all needs for everyone.
9. Akyanet can fulfill all needs for everyone.
10. Akyanet can fulfill all needs for everyone and Akyanet will be able to fulfill some needs for non-members.

Note that none of these phases mention a territory.

### Akyanet flag

The Akyanet flag (see Resources > Images) is a red and black flag (anarcho-communist flag) in the background with the Akyanet logo on top of it.

## Notes

### From PhirosWolf

First, in this document, if you read "I" without specification about who is "I", it means it is me, PhirosWolf.

Then, I would like to say that I'm not a professional in the anarcho-communist theory and I know this document lacks the application of some principles, but I just don't know how to apply them.
But all I want to do is helping making the world a better place.
This is why this document is open-source and everyone can contribute to Akyanet.

For example, in the chapter on politics, the representative system can be problematic and the idea of the Global Coordinator is maybe wrong, but I don't know, for now, how to fix it.
So if you have any suggestions or any ideas about how we could create a better system, you can create a pull request, you can direct-message me, you can create an issue on the repository, or you can create a fork of this repository.

Anyway, I hope this whole document and the future Akyanet website will help making things move.

## Introduction

The purpose of Akyanet is to be a better society and an accessible one.
This will never be a perfect society because it does not exist.
But we can try to go as close as possible to this utopia.

## Our world and our society

### What's wrong?

Actually, a lot.
The ubiquity of the money for example.
Money gives power.
And this power is concentrated in hands of a few people.
It creates gaps between people and makes us go straight into the wall.
Corruption exists mainly because of money.

Money is not the only problem.
There is also weapons of mass destruction, war, unfair justice, lack of equality, etc.
We live in a world where the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles to be part of the so-called "bourgeoisie" in the hope of feeling better.
There is something wrong about this system.
We dream of becoming rich to get the things we like.
And to do this, our current society suggests that we must compete against others and forget the ones at the bottom because they "deserved it".

### I'm fine with this system, so why change it?

Because you are not alone in this world.
Entire countries suffer from this system because they are enslaved by richer countries like Western Europe, China, and United States of America.
They are not the only ones, but the main ones to abuse from other countries.
By this I do not mean that the population of Western Europe, China, and United States of America are bad people, I just want to say that their governments and big corporations are responsible for this abuse.

The population of these wealthy countries are the mere reflection of the consumerist world we're living in today.
Some of these people live in ignorance, some are just fully indoctrinated by their societyâ€™s propaganda, and some live in the uncomfortable position of knowing what their government and big corporations perpetrate and feeling powerless to these acts.

The reason of this change becomes clear when you focus on every details of our world instead of simply following orders to look at the poor countries as "barbarian countries" and "useless countries" because they "deserved it".

## What is Akyanet?

Akyanet is a new society based on the anarcho-communist ideology.
Many fear the words "communism" and "anarchism" because of their current connation.
Let us take the first word, "communism". According to Wikipedia:
> Communism is a philosophical, social, political and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of a communist society, namely a socioeconomic orderstructured upon **the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state.**

This is pretty different from the totalitarian dictatorship many people think.
This misnamed definition perhaps originates from [McCarthyism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism) or the global fear of communism caused by the USSR and the cold war.
Basically, this propaganda from the past is having a long-lasting effect on the word "communism".

Unfortunately, this is not the only word suffering from misnaming. Let us take the case of "anarchism".
As for the previous word, here is the definition from Wikipedia:
> Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is **sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy**.
> Anarchism calls for the ""abolition of the state, which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful**.
> It is usually described alongside libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing (libertarian socialism) of the socialist movement and as having a historical association with anti-capitalism and socialism.

And the popular definition could be expressed simply by "the abolition of all rules, chaos; Confusion and disorder". But this is a confusion with [anomie](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anomie). Wiktionary:
> Alienation or social instability caused by erosion of standards and values.

Now that you have the correct definitions, we can define what is the purpose of Akyanet.

## The goals of Akyanet

Akyanet has many goals and they will evolve over time, so we will list a few foundamental ones.

"Better" should no longer mean "more profitable", it should just stick to its original definition. i.e. "To surpass in excellence; to exceed; to excel.". In Akyanet, it could also mean improving the social welfare.

Everyone should be equal. This means nobody should be oppressed, discriminated, or prevented from taking part in the development of Akyanet.

Hierarchies must be prohibited **except** when they are vital. For example, on a ship, there must be a captain to give orders as for piloting the ship correctly. But the captain must be aware that he is not in a position of power. This means that the captain could also do some chores on the ship if it does not compromise the safety of the people on board.

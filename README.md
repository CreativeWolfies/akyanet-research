# Akyanet Research

## What is Akyanet Research?

It is a project about creating documents and improving them as a part of the Akyanet project.

The documents in this repository/project are just essays about some subjects (education, society, economy, ...), but the common goal is to find a better structure for these subjects so that we can create a better society.

We are very open to suggestions and debates, because we want a structure which is better accepted and understood by people.
So don't hesitate to make a pull request! :smiley:

## Document list

- Akyanet documentation, `akyanet.md`, the documentation about the whole "better" society structure.
- About education, `education.md`, an essay about education and how we can make it better.
